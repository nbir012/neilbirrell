# Can I grow black soldier fly at home to feed my chickens, pets, process food waste?

I get asked this question quite frequently and the answer is yes, but it is not as simple as it sounds.

# Where is the black soldier fly from?

The black soldier fly originates from the Americas, first described by Linaeus in 1758. It is now very cosmopolitan, found across the world. In New Zealand, it is found in the North Island and the top of the South Island
