    "text": "After missing the bus on the way to a winery tour at Waiheke Island, I found myself chatting to a taxi driver about black soldier fly, organic waste, and sustainable protein. The driver turned out to be related to a large poultry producer in Kerala, India. I was introduced to Ashok John, owner of Summit Trades New Zealand, and six months later, I was on a plane to set-up the first black soldier fly waste treatment plant in India.\n\n\n\nOur black soldier fly stall at the agricultural trade show, Krishi Mela 2018 in Karnataka. Photo: Neil Birrell, CC-BY\n\n\nThe pilot plant was to be situated at Abhilash Hatcheries, where the company produces fertilized chicken eggs for sale, in two old poultry sheds that were no longer being used.\n\n\n\nTwo disused poultry sheds that would become the rearing facilities for producing black soldier fly eggs and larvae. Photo: Abhilash Hatcheries, CC-BY\n\n\nAs I wouldn’t be able to stay and train workers on rearing black soldier fly and processing organic waste for a long period of time, I chose to design the plant around the SANDEC/Eawag model, which has excellent openly accessible documentation1. The pilot plant has the capacity to process 21 tonnes of organic waste a week. I drew up plans and sent these through to Abhilash Hatcheries, where construction began.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruction of the facility. Photo: Neil Birrell, CC-BY\n\n\n\nIt was a fairly long flight from New Zealand, and on arrival, I was straight into it with a ceremony and presentation to the local priesthood. The area the pilot plant is based in is a majority Catholic community, so the pilot plant had to be blessed, followed by a big dinner.\nWaste is a highly sensitive subject in Kerala and other states, with problems associated with waste such as odour, flies, and leachate being of particular concern to local citizens. There have been several waste management projects that haven’t worked, impacting the health and well-being of neighbours and causing an understandable distrust and suspicion from the community of new initiatives.\nThis meant ensuring there weren’t odour, vermin, or waste water issues through site design and training. For example, training technicians how to feed the correct quantity and depth of waste to larvae to minimize the risk of anoxic conditions that allow odour-causing bacteria to establish and ensuring high densities of BSF larvae to out compete pest flies. We initially did a pilot test on a pig farm on the outskirts of Kochi, which allowed us to test the design and train technicians before moving to the final site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSorting restaurant waste into trays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSorting restaurant waste into trays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStacked trays to maximise productive surface area. The facility has a capacity of 21 tonnes of organic waste a week .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotos: Neil Birrell, CC-BY\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the lack of an effective waste management infrastructure has led to the dumping of waste on roadsides and wetlands, which is a stark contrast to the beauty of the natural environment in Kerala. There is, however, a definite appetite for fixing this and a lot of interest from people in ways to reduce these issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubbish dumped near Kerala State Pollution Control Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubbish dumped in a wetland area\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of waste being dumped in urban and rural settings. Photos: Neil Birrell, CC-BY\n\n\n\nAs Abhilash Hatcheries also sells chickens for people to grow at home, either for eggs for their use or to sell to stores, the black soldier fly larvae can also be used as a source of protein for the chickens at a domestic scale, reducing feed costs for the family. Providing training for people to use black soldier fly larvae at home to reduce their organic waste is another possible option for future.\nThere were a number of things in India that are different to what I have experienced in New Zealand, for instance, lizards getting into the enclosures and eating the larvae. The question I was asked most was “Are you married?” followed by “Do you live with your parents?”. Another learning was the regulatory environment in India is complex and slightly Kafkaesque at times. Between this and the many language differences between each state, it would make it very difficult to do business if you aren’t a local. Having a strong partnership with a local company is really important. As a side note, stopping for masala chai (with plenty of jaggery) on the way to every meeting is standard, and being late to meetings seems to be expected - there seems to be a separate time zone called Kerala time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalms in the wetlands outside Kochi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe park outside my hotel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKerala is a beautiful and unique place to visit. Photos: Neil Birrell, CC-BY\n\n\n\nOne of my favourite things from this project is I get to wake up to lots of strange photos such as newspaper clippings in different languages which have my picture in them but I haven’t the foggiest what they say.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewspaper clippings from the Kerala project.

    "text": "Education\nMy masters thesis investigated allometry and developmental plasticity in sexually selected traits of Hermetia illucens, the black soldier fly. I completed my masters in 2018.\nMy doctoral thesis, “Insects as Food in Aotearoa New Zealand” focused on past and present use of insects as food, public perceptions of insects as food, metabolomic fingerprinting of an endemic edible cerambycid beetle, Prionoplus reticularis. I also investigated the beetles’ scramble competition mating system, and, using static allometry and home-made flight mills (COVID lock-down project), I found evidence of the interplay of sexual selection and stabilising selection on traits associated with male fitness in this species. I also found evidence of sexual dimorphism, indicating the importance of female chemical cues to male mate searching. Using scanning electron microscopy, I investigated the antennal ultrastructure of male and female P. reticularis, describing unique, sexually dimorphic sensilla in this species providing further evidence of the importance of these chemical cues. In March 2024, I defended my doctoral thesis.\n\n\n\nBusiness\nDuring my Masters, I ventured into entrepreneurship and founded Hexacycle. The company established several black soldier fly waste processing plants in Kerala, India. These plants processed up to 3 tonnes of organic waste daily. This waste was converted into insect biomass, from which protein was extracted for use in poultry and pet feeds. The remaining frass (insect poo and leftover substrate) is used as a fertiliser.\nToday, I enjoy research and academia but still provide advice to companies, organisations and individuals interested in using insects as food or feed both in New Zealand and globally.\n\n\n\nService\nI am an active member of the Entomological Society of New Zealand and have been on the committee since 2018. I am currently an officer on the executive committee and was previously co-treasurer. During my studies, I was also actively involved with the early career research group of Te Pūnaha Matatini, TPM Whānau, where I held a variety of roles including Chair in 2022. TPM Whānau is a group of early career researchers from across Aotearoa New Zealand who are interested in complex systems science.\nI have also volunteered for Ark in the Park, a conservation project in the Waitākere Ranges, running a trapping line and helping out with the invertebrate sampling programme.\nI often get asked to visit schools and talk about insects and science in general - feel free to get in touch if you would like me to visit your class.\n\n\n\nWhat I do for fun\nOutside of work, I’m an avid hiker and enjoy multi-day hikes, especially to the many beautiful back country huts that Aotearoa has to offer. I also love using iNaturalist in my free time to record some of the interesting critters I see. My partner and I also have a mercurial border collie named Rimu."
