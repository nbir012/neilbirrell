# Can I grow black soldier fly at home to feed my chickens, pets, process food waste?

I get asked this question quite frequently and the short answer is yes, but to get a year round supply is challenging and costly. If your aim is to supplement the diet of pets, I would consider alternative insects such as crickets or mealworms. These are much easier to rear, have simpler environmental requirements, and have plenty of online guides available.
